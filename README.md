It is memory boosting and attractive game that I have created using frontend technologies like - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript . Game is more interesting and more popular that anyone can play itself or in his/her group and can maximize his memory power.

# How To Play ?
The main question that arises in mind is that how to play, so rule for the game is so simple when you press any key from keyboard game starts and you will see blinking any of button which is available the task is to click through mouse on that button(blinked) as soon you clicked on right button the again same or any random button will blink, here comes the amazing part you will not just click on that button only but also you have to click on the previous one that you have clicked before if you do wrongly then game will be over and you will get your score instantly.
If you follow the appropriate procedure the game level will be up accordingly.
